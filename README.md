Create an Excel file like this 


Step 1: Create a new Excel worksheet and format it:

Choose a light and soft color for the background (e.g., light gray, light blue).
Set the page orientation to landscape for a wider view.
Adjust the margin sizes to maximize the usable space without making it cluttered.
Choose a legible font like Arial or Calibri. Set the title font size slightly larger than the data font size.
Step 2: Draw gridlines:

Use Excel's "Insert" tab to add horizontal and vertical lines.
Create 6 horizontal lines to represent the different currencies.
Create 4 vertical lines to separate the columns.
Format the lines with a thin and light color (e.g., light gray).
Step 3: Add column headers:

In the first column, type "Digital Currency" and center-align the text.
In the second column, type "Price" and center-align the text.
In the third column, type "Change 24 hours" and center-align the text.
In the fourth column, type "7-Day Change" and center-align the text.
Use a slightly larger font size and a contrasting color (e.g., dark gray) for the headers.
Step 4: Add currency names:

In the first column, type the following currency names in separate rows:
BTC
ETH (Ethereum)
BNB (Binance Coin)
ZETA
ALT (altcoin)
DOGE (Dogecoin)
Center-align the text and use the same font as the headers.
Step 5: Add data and format it:

In the second column, find the current prices for each digital currency from a reliable source like CoinMarketCap.
Format the prices to display two decimal places.
In the third column, find the 24-hour change percentage for each currency and enter the values.
Use a green font color for positive changes and a red font color for negative changes.
In the fourth column, find the 7-day change percentage for each currency and enter the values.
Use the same color logic as in the third column.
Step 6: Enhance the dashboard (optional):

You can add conditional formatting to automatically change the price and change values' color based on their values.
Consider adding small chart icons next to each currency name to visually represent the price trend.
Add a title to the dashboard at the top.
Include a date stamp to indicate when the prices were last updated.
Remember:

Update the prices and change percentages regularly to keep your dashboard accurate and informative.
Customize the color scheme and format to match your preference.
You can find plenty of online tutorials and resources on creating visually appealing and informative Excel dashboards.
